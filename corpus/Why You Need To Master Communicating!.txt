Life is very complicated. People are complicated. You will constantly face challenges in life. Some might be small, and some might be big. What I’m trying to say is that life is hard. But that doesn’t mean you can’t make it easier. Let me explain.
Life is just a constant interaction with people, whether you know it or not. Every time you post something on the internet and people see it, you’re interacting with people, every time you pay the bills( even online) you interact with people, playing online games, going outside, etc.
And depending on how you communicate/treat those people, you will be treaded. In other words, the way you treat these people will determine if you get what you want in life.
For example, if you give a big warm smile to everyone, you are more likely to get better treatment than people who give a cold smile.
A warm smile, especially to people you have never met before, can make the other person feel very comfortable around you. Most of the time it could also make them lower their guard down.
If you’re in a place where no one knows anybody, that can make you more likable in the group. If you’re in a business setting, that could set the mood for business.
The more comfortable you make the other person, the better your situation. The other person you’re talking to doesn’t have to feel like they’re talking to a wall. I’m trying to say that you need to pay attention to what they’re saying. This shows the other person that you have a genuine interest in what they’re saying which could make them spill out more information and make them feel better.
And one tip to every man out there: This could make a girl fall in love with you I promise!
