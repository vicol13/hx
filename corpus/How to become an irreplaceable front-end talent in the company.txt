In recent years, the front-end has developed very fast, and the prosperity of SPA has made the front-end engineering more and more important.
In many scenarios, the complexity and difficulty of the front end has already surpassed that of the back end.But with the rapid development, the front-end has gradually exposed many problems.
As we all know, front-end practitioners rarely talk about program design principles or design ideas.This inevitably leads to the front-end code being written as spaghetti.Under the premise of the development model based on the MVVM-like framework, the front-end code naturally has component-level abstraction, and is still written as spaghetti. 
If it is the MVC era of slash and burn, it is even more unimaginable.
A front-end project in charge of a colleague frequently broke out bugs, and it has reached the level of repairing 1 bug to generate 3 bugs, and even many bugs cannot be located. I asked my colleagues why, and the answer is that the project is more complicated.Out of curiosity, I skimmed through the code for this project and found that this is typical spaghetti. Apart from the author himself, there should be no one who can or is willing to take over the project, the future destiny can only be to recruit a new person to refactor from 0, and even a line of code cannot be referencedã€‚
