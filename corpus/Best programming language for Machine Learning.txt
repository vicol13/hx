Are you new to machine learning and data science and unsure about which programming language to learn? In this article, I'll list the pros and cons of each language so that you can make an informed decision. is the most widely used programming language in machine learning and data science, but it's also a really popular language in app development and software development, so it's definitely such a useful language to learn. The main advantages of Python is that it's open source, so there are tonnes of resources and code snippets available online that you guys can easily learn from, and there's tonnes of support from various different people who have used Python, which is easily available online, and also there are so many amazing Python libraries dedicated to machine learning and deep learning, which is a huge advantage. Some of these really famous frameworks or libraries include things like tensorflow and pytorch, pandas, and scikit-learn, so there's tonnes of them. One of the biggest advantages of Python is that it is used in the machine learning industry by a lot of companies, so if you're looking to get hired, That being said, r is in very close competition with Python, and I see a lot of job openings requesting r as well. R is a programming language and software environment that was specifically designed for data analysis and statistics. It's widely used by researchers in this field, and because it's specifically designed for analysis, it's much better at it than python, which is a more general programming language. Of course, matlab comes with all of the packages that you might need, so you don't have to download anything extra on top of that. However, one significant disadvantage of matlab is that it is not open source, so you won't have the same level of support as you would with python or r.
