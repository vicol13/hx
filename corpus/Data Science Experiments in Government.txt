The health innovation hub (hih) has an intriguing mission statement: “The hih serves as a think tank, sparring partner, and implementation supporter for the Federal Ministry of Health.” Could you please share more about what the data science team does at hih? In what ways does it serve as a “sparring partner”?
The health innovation hub (hih) was created as an experiment in government: with the intention of creating a “digital task force,” the Ministry of Health in 2019 created a small group of experts that work full time for the Ministry, yet act as an independent think tank. This setup has proven effective: designed as a timeboxed project with market-rate compensation, hih brought together a diverse group of professionals for a “policy stint.”
Throughout the last years, working with the Ministry was characterized by a flexible distance — our offices are only two city blocks away from the Ministry, and have a much more startup-y vibe. At times, this meant we sat day and night with our Ministry colleagues. Other times, we were able to maintain a more “free-thinking” air outside of governmental norms.
Within data science, our work broadly fell into three buckets: policy support, education for decision makers, and hands-on projects. AI in healthcare is an exciting field. But as it is relatively new, deep understanding of its technologies is still relatively scarce in government. We helped shape thinking and lawmaking around topics such as data access and data sharing, interoperability of data standards, medical device testing, responsibility, and fairness.
What really makes work at hih unique is the cross-functional, interdisciplinary team: we bring together medical doctors, pharmacists, IT managers, journalists, data scientists, lawyers, and economists. Creating project-pods with such different real-world backgrounds allowed us to quickly come up with pragmatic solutions that would be difficult to see for any one discipline alone.
