# Search engine 
This repository represents the task from hyperexponential realized by valeriu vicol, as task of the task I decide to implement a small search_engine
on some random text blocks from random medium articles. Core algorithm used for current implementation inverted index. Idea of the search is that we type a word and the algorithm
return sentence where this word was found grouped by article name.

```dif
ðŸ“¦corpus            # list articles on which will be performed revers index
ðŸ“¦media             # images used for readme
ðŸ“¦search_engine     # implementation

## Set up the project
1. create virtual environment
```shell
python3 -m venv venv/
```
2. enter virtual environment
```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. install dependencies 
```shell
pip3 install requirements.txt
```
## Running the algorithm


1. enter the virtual environment
```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. run the algorithm
```shell
python3 main.py
```

3. run the tests
```shell
pytest
```
with coverage : 
```shell
pytest --cov
```

## Further work
For avoiding have too algorithm heavy code, this implementation represent more a PoC rather than a ready to use library. Some of the steps 
which will improve the accuracy of search_engine are listed bellow:

1. **Use a tokenizer**

    Instead of splitting sentence by '.', we should use a tokenizer as it takes into account other symbols.
    ```nltk``` tokenizer is a good choice for current task. 

2. **Use a word stemming**

    In current example algorithm won't make difference between cloud and clouds and will index them as 2 different words. In order to avoid it we should use a word stemming for 
    indexed word and for words on which we are searching. Like this we will increase the accuracy of the engine. ```nltk``` also have this functionality

3. **Implement fuzzy search**

    fuzzy searching might also a good improvement of the algorithm as the misspellings will
    be handled by algorithm in case if is not a big mistake. For fuzzy search we can use 
    something like levenshtein distance.

4. **word2vec**

    we can keep vector representation of each indexed word and then when we have a query we turn the input also into a vector and get the results based on distance of the vectors. Using this approach we can get even better results as we will get results based on vector similarity not on string matching.
